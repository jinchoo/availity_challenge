## 1.  Tell me about your proudest professional achievement. 
 
When I worked at Simple Tech Talk, we were able to produce something that people can use our platform and gain knowledge everyday.  I would say, that is a job well done.  And of course, we are always trying to improve the platform everyday.   
 
 
## 2.  Tell me about something you have read recently that you would recommend and why.
 
I would recommend reading Narnia.  I would recommend the book because it forces you to use your imagination and how powerful your imagination can be.  The book is also very special to me because my husband and I would read the book together, the book is my happy place.
 
## 3.  How would you explain to your grandmother what Availity does?
 
It is one-stop-portal where you can connect with your payers, can check eligibility, submit claims, and collect patient payments.
